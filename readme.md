## About

This list should contain verified sources of FROST implementations and updates that are either currently in use or can be considered interesting - therefore awesome.

## Chronological Updates

For the convenience, the most recent projects are dated and on top to follow the community progress.

- [RFC 9591 for FROST tracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9591/): RFC 9591 tracker for The Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold (FROST) Protocol for Two-Round Schnorr Signatures.

- [Rust implementation of FROST by the Zcash Foundation](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost): Rust implementation of FROST by the Zcash Foundation

- [A BIP draft for BIP340-compatible FROST threshold signing protocol](https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing): A standard for the Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold (FROST) signing protocol. The standard is compatible with BIP340 public keys and signatures. It supports tweaking, which allows deriving BIP32 child keys from the group public key and creating BIP341 Taproot outputs with key and script paths.

- [JavaCard implementation of FROST](https://github.com/crocs-muni/JCFROST): JCFROST is a JavaCard implementation of FROST threshold signature scheme using public JavaCard API complying with the IRTF standardization draft.

- [BlockchainCommons: Awesome source for FROST developers](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/): BlockchainCommons runs regular FROST developer meetings.

- 04.01.2025 [ChillDKG: Distributed Key Generation for FROST](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/bip-frost-dkg): Enhanced distributed key generation protocol (DKG) for use with the FROST Schnorr threshold signature scheme.
